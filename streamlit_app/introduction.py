    # Introduction to the project
    st.markdown("""
    Welcome to our time-series forecasting project, where we delve into predicting the unit sales for thousands of items across the Favorita stores located in Ecuador. Corporaci√≥n Favorita, a leading grocery retailer in Ecuador, presents a rich dataset comprising dates, store and product information, promotional activity, and unit sales.

    This web application serves a dual purpose:
    - **Presentation of Results**: Offering an in-depth look at our exploratory data analysis, feature engineering efforts, and the performance of our machine learning model.
    - **Interactive User Application**: Allowing users to interact with the model, explore predictions, and gain insights into sales forecasting for Favorita's diverse product range.

    Our challenge encompasses not just forecasting sales but also understanding the intricate relationships between various factors influencing sales across multiple store locations and product families.
